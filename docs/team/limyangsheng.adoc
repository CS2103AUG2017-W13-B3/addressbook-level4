=== Enhancement Added: Backup/RestoreBackup

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=backupandrestore]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Users may lose their original copy of saved data for many reasons. The file may be corrupted or they may clear their contact and then save by accident.
As such, the backup and restore backup command will allow users to retrieve back their loss data.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=backupandrestore]

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Proposed: Person and Meeting hashmap data structure

Every time a person object is updated, the corresponding meeting object has to be updated as well.
This is because the meeting object contains a person object.
With a hashmap data structure, updating a person will be much faster as compared to looping through a list.
